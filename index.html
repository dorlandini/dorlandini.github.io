	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I&#39;m a marketing go-to guy, aspiring writer, jack-of-all-trades kind-of-guy living in Miami. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I&#39;m not artistic enough to become a great designer and not focused enough to become a hardcore coder, but I am fully determined to become a social entrepreneur and this is a trade I want to add to my collection of useful practical knowledge.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>

	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a opportunity creator with communities, businesses and individuals around the world, because I like to work in a pro-active, highly-diverse, socially-conscious environment that results in a sense of purpose for myself and lasting benefits for others.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>

	This is how I&#39;ve evolved professionally:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>World Traveler</strong></li>
		<i>Asia &amp; Europe, Nov 12 - May 13</i>
		<br></br>

		<li><strong>Marketing Manager</strong>, Blinds, Shades and Shutters Corp.</li>

		<i>Rollins College, 2011</i>
		<br></br>

		</ul>

	<h2>Other</h2>
	
	<p>In the past two years I&#39;ve travel to 64 towns and cities across the world, I&#39;ve volunteered as an English teacher in certain countries, I&#39;ve built my family&#39;s business online presence from the ground up, and I&#39;ve restructured the product data management and CRM of a wholesale distributor while designing and implementing their marketing and advertising channels and supporting their sales efforts. I am also writing a book on my spare time. I practice Transcendental Meditation and run every morning. My next (ad)venture is to build a global ecommerce company to bring technology and innovative products to markets yet to be explored while echoing the one for one movement.</p>
