		<title>Airbnb.com vs Helloflo.com</title>

	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.airbnb.com" target="none">Airbnb.com</a> and <a href="www.http://helloflow.com" target="none">Helloflo.com</a></p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

	<p>Airbnb.com use of space is clearly defined. Lots of negative space to emphasize the images and the search bar. Search bar is in a dark bar to create contrast. Not much text is used. Text size is clearly differentiated between titles and subtitles.
	One central image that leads to the search bar. One large title but comparably smaller in relation with the image background. Images stand out. Text is not overwhelming.
	Lots of white space to accentuate the images and call to action.</p>

	<p>Helloflo.com has many elements in the page but they seem to work well. The orange color of the slider and the animation draws attention. Lots of text in different size and colors; it is distracting, but somehow effective.  Signup box is out of the grid, making it stand out.
	Animations are larger. Company logo is larger. Titles are a lot larger. Call to actions are larger.
	Not much space, seems like every portion of the page is covered in color. Even the white space has colored text. It gives a sense of confusion but it is appealing.

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	
	<p>Airbnb.com is simple and clean with tons of negative space to draw focus to the search bar and exalt the images. It follows a clearly defined grid.</p>
	
	<p>Helloflo.com has a lot of color and images and text sizes, creating a sense of chaos and numerous calls to action. It does not follow the grid.</p>


	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

	<ul>
	<li><strong>Airbnb</strong></li>
	<img>
	<p>The focal point is clearly the search bar. As a landing page the navigation is super simple, few options, buttons are well contrasted, images are linkable, and few enough. Text title/subtitle shows a easy to follow hierarchy. The flow is natural and intuitive. Hero image to search bar on above the fold, makes for a clean look and feel. Below, images and short title are easy to follow. Top to bottom. Centered.</p>

	<li><strong>Helloflo</strong></li>
	<img>
	<p>I think the focal point is the text in the negative area, though I can't be sure because there are too many elements fighting for my attention. They fail to achieve a clear hierarchy with the text using diffirent colors. Too many calls of action and buttons, hard to find the focal point. Too much color and too many options distracts me. Donâ€™t know where to focus my attention. Animation is distracting. I do like the elements outside the grid.</p>
	</ul>
